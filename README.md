# CsBasic_CSharp

This is my tesbed project for data structures and algorithms. 
This is a Visual Studio Code / C# project

* ArrayList contains sorting, binary search and other list related stuff. (I currently have insertion-soft, bubblesort and quicksort (using both the basic and Hoares partitionning algorithms). Need to add a merge sort as well.)

* LinkedList contains stack and queue implementatons and related fun stuff.

* BinaryTrees contains basic (i.e., binary search) tree and AVL tree implementations and realted stuff. I plan to add red-black tress as well.

* Graphs contains bredth-first, depth-first and othe graph related fun stuff (e.g., check if graph is acyclic, print ranges, etc.). 

Note: If you choose to browse this code, note that I am pretty bad at memorizing code, so the code is created from a mental imlage of the algorithm. As such the code may not reflect the coe in other reference material and text books.  

Note: The project is a testbed so stuff is always being added, deleted, updated, fixed.
